# Yaesu FT-857D front panel protocol 
Goal of this project is to explore the undocumented serial protocol, that connects the FT-857D tranceiver and its front panel and create simple tools to control both, the radio tranceiver and the front panel.

## Why?
Knowing the protocol enables us, for exmple, to
 * Establish a remote connection
 * Develop additional or replacement displays or control panels
 * Add features to the radio
 * Modify the menu structure
 
Also because I personally do not like undocumented protocols. And for the fun of it.
